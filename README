Troois: Like Amazon S3 on Google App Engine

Goal: Install Troois to your Google App Engine account, and you can send/retrieve files, a bit like on Amazon S3.

Who would use Troois instead of Amazon S3, which is so cheap?
- Open source project who have zero money.
- People who want zero running costs.

Limitations:
- No encryption
- No authentication

Ruby code to send a file:
    troois_url = 'http://your-troois-app.appspot.com/' # Configure yours here
    require 'open-uri'
    require 'rest_client'
    form = open(troois_url) {|f| f.read }
    post_url = form.gsub(/.*action=\"/, '').gsub(/\" method.*/, '')
    puts 'Dynamic URL for Google App Engine blobstore upload:' + post_url
    key = RestClient.post post_url, :file => File.new('your-file.odt', 'rb')
    puts 'File now available at: ' + troois_url + 'serve/' + key

Then anyone with the URL can download the file.
The URL contains a very long randomly-generated unique key.

TODO:
The Ruby code above could proably be improved to remove the form-parsing step.
